---

* SLEEPTIGHT mattress, used for 5 months only

* Bought it from Fantastic furniture for $149 but can't find it on the website anymore but it's very similar to [this one](https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/ingleburn/beds/tokyo-double-bed-frame-with-dream-classic-double-mattress/1248498840)

* If you buy it with the mattress (bought for $149), you can get both for $100
